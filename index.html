<h1>JUAN'S FIRST HTML HEADING!!!</h1>

<h2>Juan's Second (albeit, smaller) HTML Heading!</h2>

<p>Hello! This page was written in HTML for an 'Intro to Web Development' class that Juan is taking at the College of Staten Island at the City University of New York (CUNY). Juan is really passionate about getting a good grade in this class, so please look upon this meager attempt to construct his first webpage with as much sympathy (or pity) that you can muster- because he dearly needs it!</p>

<p>Regardless of whatever judgment you may have already placed upon him, please note that the following information provided in the remainder of this web page was made with the utmost love and compassion Juan has for his fellow man.</p>
